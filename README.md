# Sunny (Sungyoung) Kim Homepage

##### I am a second-year Master’s student in Data Science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning and Control Systems, with a particular focus on understanding how structural similarities between a neural network’s computational graph and a task’s underlying dynamics can facilitate faster optimization in reinforcement learning. Previously, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and worked as a Data & Analytics Consultant at Ernst & Young.
