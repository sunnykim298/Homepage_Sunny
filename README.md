Hello, My name is Sunny (Sungyoung) Kim, a second-year Master’s student in Data Science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). 
My research interests are Deep/Reinforcement Learning and Dynamical Systems, with a particular focus on understanding Neural Network's controllability and observability dynamics. Before joining graduate school, I studied B.A. Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and worked as a Data & Analytics Consultant at Ernst & Young.
