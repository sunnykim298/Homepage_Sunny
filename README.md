# Sunny (Sungyoung) Kim Homepage

##### I am a 2nd year Data Science Masters student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology. My interests are Reinforcement Learning and Control Systems, with particular focus on understanding the mechanism behind how similarity in a neural network's computational graph and task structure induces faster optimization in Reinforcement Learning. Previously, I obtained Bachelor's of Arts in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge and worked as a data & analytics consultant and Ernst & Young.
