**Introduction** <br>
Hello, My name is Sungyoung Kim, a second-year Master’s student in Data Science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). 
Before joining graduate school, I studied B.A. Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and worked as a Data & Analytics Consultant at Ernst & Young.

**Research** <br>
My research interests are deep/reinforcement learning and dynamical systems, with a focus on understanding controllability and observability dynamics in artificial neural networks. Specifically, my work consists of:

- formulating a control-theoretic perspective on learning dynamics by viewing a single optimization step as a locally linear state-space system, inducing gramian-based controllability (C) and observability (O) matrices (<a href="./research_idea_vFF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Initial Research Idea, Nov 2024</a>)<br>
- characterizing C/O matrices and their spectral statistics across tasks and architectures, and elucidating their relation with generalization, regularization, and task class (e.g. perceptual vs. relational) <br>
- developing C/O-grounded methods for circuit identification in neural networks, testing the hypothesis that mechanistically interpretable neurons concentrate in low-dimensional subspaces spanned by dominant balanced modes <br>

Besides my main interests, I have also consistently enjoyed learning about fluids, waves, and airplanes.
