Hello, My name is Sunny (Sungyoung) Kim, a second-year Master’s student in Data Science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). 
Before joining graduate school, I studied B.A. Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and worked as a Data & Analytics Consultant at Ernst & Young.

My research interests are Deep/Reinforcement learning and Dynamical Systems, with a focus on understanding artificial neural networks' learning in the control theoretic perspective.
Specifically, it consists of 
- suggesting the framework of viewing an optimization step as a linearized state-space system to deduce controllability (C) and observability (O) gramian-based metrics
  - existing literature
  - <a href="./adhd_compneuro_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> C, O framework v0.1 (last updated Nov 2024) <br>
- studying C, O matrices (e.g. trace, log-det, alignment, eigenspectrum) for various tasks (e.g. perceptual, relational, algebraic) and architectures (e.g. CNN, GNN, Deepsets, MLP)
  - C, O metrics predicted generalization accuracy across different hyperparameter settings within a task - architecture pair
  - distinct C, O dynamics observed across different tasks, in line with the task properties
  - regularizing C, O changes 
- 

Besides my main interests, I consistently liked learning about fluids, waves and airplanes.
