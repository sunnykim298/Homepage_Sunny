**Introduction** <br>
Hello, My name is Sungyoung Kim, a second-year Master’s student in Data Science at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). 
Before joining graduate school, I studied B.A. Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and worked as a Data & Analytics Consultant at Ernst & Young.

**Research** <br>
My research interests are deep/reinforcement learning and dynamical systems, with a focus on understanding how artificial neural networks learn from a control-theoretic perspective. Specifically, my work consists of:

• proposing a framework that views a single optimization step as a linearized state-space system, enabling controllability (C) and observability (O) Gramian-based metrics, extending common parameter-to-logit or input-to-output analyses to include representations in the loop (<a href="./adhd_compneuro_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> C, O framework v0.1, last updated Nov 2024 </a>)<br>
• analyzing C/O matrices (e.g., trace, log-det, alignment, eigenspectrum) across tasks (perceptual, relational, algebraic) and architectures (CNNs, GNNs, DeepSets, MLPs), relating these metrics to generalization across hyperparameter settings, task-dependent dynamics, and regularization strategies that shape the learning curve <br>
• developing C/O-based methods to identify circuits in neural networks, in the mechanistic interpretability sense <br>

Besides my main interests, I have also consistently enjoyed learning about fluids, waves, and airplanes.
